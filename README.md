The purpose of this project is to predict Food Rating for a test set based on the model training on train set and accuracy score on validation set.
The project is based on Classification Algorithm.
It consists of various Long Text fields that have been vectorized using TF-IDF vectorizer.
Of most of the classification algorithms, XGBoost surpassed the cut-off score and gave the highest accuracy.
